	"\n\n"
	"By Melody S. Gee"
	"\n\n"
	"The wound on her lip goes white before returning red."
	"\n\n"
	"The virus erupts the lines between chin and lip, between lip and philtrum."
	"\n\n"
	"A sore across two continents of skin, a bridge of lava."
	"\n\n"
	"She will feel healed when the flesh color returns. The variation is the aberration. Blood courses to deliver a clot. Vessels bouquet under the scalp or in the womb, in places where we heal fastest. Cells scramble a lean-to scab, a mortar of new skin."
	"\n\n"
	"The body wants to draw its seams together."
	"\n\n"
	"But Jesus hangs before the convert eternally wounded, eternally weeping from his gashes."
	"\n\n"
	"How to open hers without nails or thorns? How to measure heartbeats without seeing blood heave out its rhythms?"
	"\n\n"
	"A gush slows under pressure even as the pulse goes on. Our lesions take air, our infections seek sunlight. How to resist our unwilled mechanisms to staunch?"
	"\n\n"
	"We push through the same tear in the world and leave it sore."
	"\n\n"
	"When we come, we come open."
	"\n\n"
	"Pick a wound slow to bleed and slower to seal. We cream the scar to fade our atlas of livingâ€”what itched its way to a silver road, what shadow constellation of pox. The convert counts Jesus' wounds."
	"\n\n"
	"If you count both hands and both feet, all lashes and piercings and the forsaken cry, the number is higher and lower than anyone's.";
