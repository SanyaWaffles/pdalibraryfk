# pdalibraryfk

pdalibraryfk is a fork of an earlier version of Nash Muhandes' PDA Library that retains the 3 Clause BSD License earlier versions had.

It was forked with permission as long as I don't copy/paste any new code features past 1.0.

I mainly aimed to fork this for use in DD2 and beyond's codebases, which use a 3 Clause BSD License with MIT code and would be incompatible.

It won't have all the features of his, but I don't need all the features of his. All I need is the ability to navigate menus with the keys/gamepad.

Why did I call it pdalibraryfk? Because fk if I know.
